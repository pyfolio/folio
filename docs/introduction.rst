What is Folio?
--------------

Folio is a library/tool which is used to generate static HTML files from Jinja2
templates.

It's written in Python and it's Open Source (`ISC license`_).

Although it's written from scratch, is well inspired in existing *static website
generator* projects and mainly in Flask_ microframework, so people how already
know it will feel like home.
